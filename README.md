# Goals
Check de-anonymization risk of Tor Browser users, through:

- mouse-over from one browser to the other
- switching browsers with hotkeys (implementation pending)


There are probably many ways the user can be de-anonymized. 
Not all are examined here.


# Limitations 

I haven't taken into account all scenarios, e.g.: 
- user trying to deceive the server by manipulating data
- interrupted data transfer
- changing IP during session
- assignment of IP to new user
